# Evil Hangman
In the game of hangman, one player (in this case, a computer) chooses a word that the other player (the user) must guess. The guesser guesses individual letters until either the entire word is revealed (in which case the guesser wins) or a certain number of wrong letters are guessed (in which case the guesser loses). The position of the correct letters in the secret word is given to the guesser as they are guessed.


In our EVIL! hangman game, the computer waits until it is compelled to pick a specific secret word. As a result, the computer is always thinking about a group of terms that might be the secret word. The computer deceives the user into believing it is playing fairly.
